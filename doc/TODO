================================== To-do List ==================================

Important:

* Threading. At current state, the Messenger does not exit when parent
  is exiting.
* Use an actual timer between requests so that sleeping between them is
  accurate. Now the sleep is just added to the overall time it takes for
  the scan+processing.
* Fix the Max problem bug. More documentation about it can be found inside
  the FoursquareExplore service file.


Main program:

* Change the design of the services a bit so development is easier:
  - logger.log_scan could be automated so user doesn't need to handle it
  - use a set of properties for a service. These "rules" are essentially
    the constrains of the service.
* Add filters. These can be services themselves or something else that filters
  away some of the markers by providing a criteria.
* Make it easy to link a populator service with a filter.
* Let the user merge services.


GUI:

* Make markers clickable. Once the marker is clicked, it should either show some
  info passed by the service or use Google Places to show info.
* Make it possible to change the marker icon. Use some default ones.
* Controls like PAUSE and STOP.


Logging:

* Save file downloaded from the service. At least on error for easy debugging.
