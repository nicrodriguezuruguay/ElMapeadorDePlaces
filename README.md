Geoexplorer
========================================================================

Geoexplorer is a framework meant to be used for black-box-testing
and/or scraping data from geographic services like Google Places
and Foursquare.

Full documentation both for developers and users can be
found in the *doc* folder of the project. The full API is there as well.



Install dependencies
========================================================================

**Ubuntu 13.10**

Works out of the box.

**Ubuntu 12.04**

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-lxml

**Windows 7**

1. Download and install *python3.2* from http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2.5
2. Edit windows path
    * Go to *Control Panel* > *System* > *Advanced system settings*
    * Click the *Environment variables..* button
    * Edit *PATH* and append `;C:\python32\`
3. Install the *lxml3.2* from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/3.2.4


Usage
========================================================================

  1. Run `python3 examples/<example>.py` substituting *\<example\>* with one
     of the example files
  2. Open `GUI/index.html` with a webbrowser to see live what is going on

Some services like *Google Radar* require an **API** key. You can edit that by
adding it in the source (ie. examples/google_radar_search.py).

Once running, a folder called *log* will be created at the current directory.
This folder with be populated with log files on-the-fly. These can be used to
debug the search and see the results.


Configuration
========================================================================

The config.py keeps all the applicable options for Geoexplorer in a single file.
Each option is described bellow:
 
      GUI_PORT                -> Port being used for the communication with the
                                 GUI
      
      LOG_PATH                -> Folder name where logs should be stored
      LOG_SCANNING_FILENAME   -> Name of file for logging scanning steps
      LOG_SESSION_FILENAME    -> Name of file for logging statistics fom each
                                 scanning session
      LOG_RESULTS_FILENAME    -> Name of file for logging every single result
      NEW_FOLDER_EACH_SESSION -> Should a new folder be created on each scanning
                                 session?
      
      BOUNDS                  -> The coordinates lat, lng, lat2, lng2 for
                                 scanning. 
      
      'box'
      X_DISTANCE              -> Desirable distance in m. for a box' x axis
      Y_DISTANCE              -> Desirable distance in m. for a box' y axis

      'scheduler'
      NEXT_SEARCH_WAIT        -> Seconds to wait before going scanning next box

The 'service' entry (not shown above) is used as a template by the services and should not
be altered.


Logging
========================================================================

There are three files for logging different things.

      SESSION:  Different statistics for the whole scanning session
      SCANNING: This is the main debugging log file. Every scanning step is recorded
                in this file.
      RESULTS:  This keeps all the results extracted during the scanning session


Troubleshooting
========================================================================

**The map in the GUI doesn't show any boxes.**

*A.* Try to install the latest firefox web browser. The GUI will not work
   for old browsers(IE8 for example).
